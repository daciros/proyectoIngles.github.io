                <p><br><br><br>The idea of creating a gigantic image of Christ,<br>as a meeting point on pilgrimages and religious celebrations, dates back to the<br>late nineteenth century. The suggestion was brought to the knowledge of<br>the&nbsp;Princess
                    Isabel of Brazil,<br>who gave the first official support to make such a great proposal, however, the<br>project would begin to take shape in 1921 on the occasion of celebrating the<br>centenary of independence.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p class="text-center">The choice of the place where this famous image was placed was in charge of the Catholic circle of Rio de Janeiro. The Corcovado mountain had as competitors the Pão Of Açúcar and to Mount San Antonio, but&nbsp;He was elected because he
                    was the highest of the three. &nbsp;<br>In 1923, through a contest, the engineer's<br>project was chosen&nbsp;Heitor Da Silva Costa, with plastic artist design&nbsp;Carlos Oswald&nbsp;And projected by the French architect&nbsp;Paul
                    Landowsky, who came from Europe especially for this work.<br></p>

            </div>
            <p><br>Before reaching its present form, the image of<br>Christ the Redeemer had several modifications. The approved project of Heitor<br>Da Silva consisted of the image of&nbsp;Jesus<br>holding a cross in his left hand and a globe on the other
                hand&nbsp;That,<br>according to Princess Isabel, were the most important material attributes in<br>the vision of the engineer.&nbsp;<br><br>To achieve the perfection of the current image<br>it was necessary to adopt the grid technique.
                With the body standing and arms<br>extended the construction of the monument began; Thus, the face, directed a<br>little downward and left, was also strategically planned to give the appearance<br>of being sheltering the city.<br><br>At
                last&nbsp;On October 12th, 1931 was inaugurated&nbsp;The Monument of Christ<br>the Redeemer, which years later was consecrated as a symbol of Brazilian<br>tourism and, today, is one of the 7 new wonders of the modern world.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="text-center"><br>The National Museum of American History opened to the public in January 1964 as the Museum of History and Technology. It was the sixth Smithsonian building on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Since then, some 4 million visitors
                    a year have passed through the doors to enjoy the museum’s exhibitions, public programs, educational activities, collections, and research facilities. Millions more make virtual visits to the museum’s website.<br><br><br>On June 28,
                    1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill authorizing $36 million for the museum. Groundbreaking took place on August 22, 1958. The architects were McKim, Mead and White (succeeded in 1961 by Steinman, Cain and White). Mills,
                    Petticord and Mills were associate and supervising architects and engineers. The museum’s area is approximately 750,000 square feet, including a basement, three main exhibition levels, two office-collection levels, and a mechanical
                    penthouse on the roof.<br><br>The building’s location on the National Mall qualifies it as a National Historic Landmark. Its status as one of the last structures designed by the renowned architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White,
                    along with its location, makes it eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.<br><br>In 1980, the museum’s name was changed to the National Museum of American History to better represent its basic mission—the
                    collection, care, and study of objects that reflect the experience of the American people.<br><br></p>

        <p><br>In 2008, the museum completed a two-year, $85 million renovation of the building’s center core, dramatically transforming the building’s architectural appeal while reorganizing and renewing the presentation of its extensive collections. The
            renovation project focused on three areas: architectural enhancements to the center core, including a grand staircase and a skylight; construction of a new&nbsp;<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/star-spangled-banner">Star-Spangled Banner gallery</a>,
            and updates to the 44-year-old building’s infrastructure.<br><br>Currently, the transformation of the museum is continuing with a&nbsp;<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/museum/renovation">major project to renew</a>&nbsp;the building’s

                    achieved by its builders in the field of architecture<br>and work in stone. The joints of the stones in some of the environments are so<br>narrow that not a pin could be inserted. The most significant stone is the<br>"Intihuatana"or
                    solar calendar, which allowed the Incas to know<br>precisely the seasons and the climate throughout the year. However, many find<br>in Machu Picchu more than history and ancient technologies, but also an energy<br>and peace that surrounds
