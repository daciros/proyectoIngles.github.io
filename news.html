                        <p><br>Running through Tanzania and Kenya, this is where the human story really begins, the earliest signs of Homo sapiens and our predecessor hominids, and it's therefore where we should go back to when thinking about that great
                            original migration out of Africa, and across the rest of the world, which happened 70,000 years ago.We are all ultimately from the same family. We are all Africans. (And for those who think the BBC's awash with money and sent
                            me to do the History of the World so I could visit all the places I wanted to, I should point out that I have never been there.)<br><br></p>
                        <p><strong>The Yellow River</strong><br></p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/63435000/jpg/_63435319_yellowriver_afp_464.jpg">
                        <p><br></p>
                        <p><br>This turbulent, explosive river, "China's Sorrow" is where we find the beginning of Han Chinese civilization, as tribes and villagers are forced to knit themselves together in order to dig channels to stop the regular and disastrous
                            flooding.<br><br>Rivers turn out to be absolutely vital for human social development, and we could equally well choose the Euphrates, the Indus, the Nile, or even the Volga, as examples.<br><br>But we are living through a time
                            in world history when China is rising again, and it's both useful and interesting to knit Chinese history back into the world narrative after a couple of centuries when Western condescension and ignorance (and Chinese indifference)
                            has rather pushed it aside.<br><br>The parallels between the Han empire and the Roman one, co-existing for centuries, are remarkable, for instance - and it is still impossible to understand modern China without understanding
                            Confucius.<br><br></p>

                        <p><br>Today, poor Athens is the scene of violent social protest, fast-increasing poverty and rising political tension, which were all present before, and even during, her Golden Age in classical times when she produced the philosophers,
                            the architects, the political thinkers and the poets who in turn shaped all Western civilization.<br><br>Take a short car or bus ride to the coast nearby and wander on the sandy, pine-wooded shoreline where the Battle of Marathon
                            was fought in 490 BC, and where the Athenians' citizen army defeated the vastly numerically superior forces of Persian tyranny.<br><br>It's still the most important battle in Western history. One of the very few markers left
                            is a little mound, or hillock, nearby. It's in a smallish triangle of grassy land, not much bigger than a children's park and surrounded by roads. But inside that hillock lie the remains of the Athenians who fought and died
                            at Marathon.<br><br>It choked me up when I first saw it because of its spectacular and moving lack of grandeur - no winged gods or angels, no marble, no pompous inscriptions, just a simple pile of earth.<br><br>These are again
                            days of Greek agony and instead of constantly blaming them for not working hard enough like the Germans, we should help by continuing to go, to spend money there, and show our friendship.<br><br>I'm afraid I also think the
                            time is right to send back the Parthenon frieze or Elgin Marbles from our wonderful British Museum. They need a real boost just now and we are in a unique position to help.<br><br></p>
