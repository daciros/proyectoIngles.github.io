                        <p><br>Although Cairo is currently the capital of the country and its largest<br>city, its position of prominence in the global reckoning of Egyptian history is<br>still very recent. The city did not even exist at the time of the
                            construction<br>of the pyramids. At that time, Memphis, located 24 km (15 miles) south, was the<br>Pharaonic capital. Cairo was founded when the Romans rebuilt an ancient Persian<br>fortress by the Nile, in what is now Old
                            Cairo, in the year 116 A.D.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                        <p>From the end of the 9th<br>century onward, A succession of Arab rulers left His footprint in the country:<br>Ibn Tulun He built his royal city of El-Qatai And the Fatim√≠s built the walled<br>city of El-Qahira, from which it takes
                            the name Cairo. In the 13th century, the<br>Mamluks, a caste of soldiers of Turkish origin, took power. They were later<br>succeeded by the Ottomans, by the Frenchmen under Napoleon and finally by the<br>British. The birth
                            of modern Cairo took place in 1863, when the Governor Ismail<br>carried out the expansion of the capital along the Nile in the style of the<br>large European cities. After the return of sovereignty to the Egyptians in 1952,<br>Cairo
                            quickly became the capital of the Arab world.</p>

                    <p><br>The Ottomans conquered Cairo in 1517 and ruled there until 1798 when the area was captured during an expedition led by Napoleon I of France. Ottoman rule was restored in 1801, but by the middle of the 19th century, Egypt's foreign
                        debt and the weakness of the Ottoman Empire invited greater European influence in Cairo. The Viceroy Ismail Pasha, who ruled from 1863 to 1879, built many European-style structures in the city and used the occasion of the opening
                        of the Suez Canal northeast of Cairo in 1869 to showcase the city for the European powers. However, much of the development that took place during this period was funded by foreign loans, which led to an increase in the national
                        debt and left Cairo vulnerable to control by Great Britain. The British effectively ruled Egypt from Cairo from the late 19th century through the period after World War I (1914-1918), when the foreign presence in Cairo began to
                        diminish.<br><br></p>
